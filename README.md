## Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?
I start by grounding my designs in real-world examples. For this project, I based my scene on an actual PCBA placed on an ESD mat. Building around something real helped structure my thinking and ensured the software met practical standards of accuracy and realism.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project improved my ability to create more realistic textures from real-world images and to design 3D scenes that reflect industrial environments. I also got better at modularizing my rendering logic to keep the project clean and expandable.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative process: setting up basic objects first, then layering on details like silkscreen textures, reflective materials, and custom models for components such as capacitors, inductors, and ICs.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Starting from real-world references, modularizing functions, and refining through small improvements are methods I will use to develop more advanced and accurate digital twin systems for manufacturing applications.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I take a steady, practical approach: get something simple working first, then build complexity in layers, testing after each addition to make sure the foundation stays strong.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I emphasized modularity, writing helper functions for rendering tasks. I also experimented with integrating custom real-world textures to give the models a professional-level polish.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was key. Each pass through the project added details or fixed smaller issues like material inconsistencies, especially when trying to match the look of real industrial surfaces.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I became more disciplined about refining each section before moving on, which helped avoid major bugs and allowed the final scene to feel polished rather than patched together.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
It bridges the gap between my hands-on PCB/SMT engineering experience and the growing need for software-driven automation, inspection, and visualization tools in manufacturing.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Working with 3D environments deepened my understanding of spatial organization, texturing, and scene optimization — skills that will directly support more advanced studies in digital twin development and smart manufacturing technologies.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Skills like integrating real-world imagery into accurate 3D models and modularizing graphics logic will help me design better inspection systems and support the future of automated visual inspection and simulation in manufacturing.
